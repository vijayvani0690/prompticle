PromptCraft v1.0 (MVP-1) - Complete Overview
1. What We've Built
PromptCraft is an AI-powered prompt builder that generates optimized, platform-specific prompts for website builders like Bolt.new, Lovable, and v0 by Vercel. Users describe what they want through a visual wizard or paste a PRD for AI analysis, and the app generates a tailored, ready-to-use prompt.
